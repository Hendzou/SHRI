# SHRI
Spoken Human-Robot Interaction using Python, Prolog, Stanford NLP server and Google ASR
Objective:
Considering a task oriented Spoken Dialog System, where the user helps the agent
execute tasks of moving familiar objects in a house-like environment, we want to
manage the robotâ€™s self awareness. That would allow the robot to communicate
informations about its physical state.
Ressources: (compatible with python 2.7 and on Linux)
